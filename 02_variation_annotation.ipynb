    "## 1. Allele Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**\n",
    "An *allele frequency* is the proportion of all alleles in a population represented by a particular allele.\n",
    "For autosomal loci, each person carries two alleles—one maternal, one paternal—so the total number of alleles equals twice the number of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Calculation**\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "\\text{Allele frequency of A} = \\frac{2(#AA) + (#AB) + (#AC)}{2n}\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "where *n* is the number of individuals sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Homozygotes contribute two copies of the same allele.\n",
    "* Heterozygotes contribute one copy of each.\n",
    "* The sum of all allele frequencies at a locus equals 1.0.\n",

    "## 2. How ClinVar Determines Clinical Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "ClinVar **does not assign** pathogenicity; it **aggregates** submissions from laboratories, researchers, and expert panels.\n",
    "Submitters usually follow the **ACMG/AMP guidelines**, which classify variants into five tiers based on multiple lines of evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tier                             | Meaning                                                    | Typical Certainty / Actionability          |\n",
    "| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n",
    "| **Pathogenic**                   | Strong evidence that the variant causes disease.           | High certainty; supports diagnosis/action. |\n",
    "| **Likely Pathogenic**            | Very likely disease-causing (> 90%).                       | Often treated as pathogenic.               |\n",
    "| **Uncertain Significance (VUS)** | Evidence insufficient or conflicting.                      | Low certainty; not clinically actionable.  |\n",
    "| **Likely Benign**                | Very likely harmless (> 90%).                              | Unlikely to cause disease.                 |\n",
    "| **Benign**                       | Strong evidence of non-pathogenicity /common polymorphism. | High certainty; not disease-causing.       |\n",

    "## 3. Understanding ClinVar Review Status (“Gold Stars”)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Review Status** indicates the **quality and consensus** of submitted interpretations and appears as ⭐ stars in ClinVar.\n",
    "\n",
    "| ⭐ Count                                                        | Review Status                                           | Meaning |\n",

    "| **2 ⭐ – Criteria Provided, Multiple Submitters, No Conflicts** | Independent submitters agree; criteria documented.      |         |\n",

    "## 4. Using These Fields in Variant Annotation and Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a machine-learning dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `ClinicalSignificance` to create binary labels (1 = pathogenic / likely pathogenic; 0 = benign / likely benign).\n",
    "2. Exclude records with uncertain or conflicting interpretations.\n",
    "3. Optionally filter or weight examples by Review Status (star rating).\n",
    "4. Keep allele frequency (from gnomAD or dbSNP) as a key feature — common alleles are usually benign.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Allele frequency** quantifies how common a variant is in a population.\n",
    "* **ClinVar** aggregates variant interpretations; its *Clinical Significance* and *Review Status* fields are crucial for labeling datasets.\n",
    "* **Higher Review Status** = higher confidence in pathogenicity assessment.\n",
    "* Understanding these concepts is essential before automating variant labeling and model training.\n",
